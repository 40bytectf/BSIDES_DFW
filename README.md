#BSIDES DFW CTF
####@40bytectf

The challenges that are stand-alone (no server required) will be posted here.

If you encounter a folder with no files, that's an interactive challenge and will be posted later in the day.


Please create a team name and send 1 email per team to **40bytectf@gmail.com** with a subject:  **DFW TEAM _teamname_**


Flags for the challenges will be in the format of   "**flag{someflagcharactershere}**"  without the quotes.


Once you've solved a challenge, send an email with subject **DFW TEAM <teamname> CRYPTO100**  <- chnage as required to reflect the challenge you've solved.   With the flag in the body of the email

*Please do NOT send questions to this mailbox, they will be ignored.  Solutions and registrations only*.

We will be on **IRC FREENODE #40bytectf** - you can ask questions there, but please no spoilers.

Have fun!
